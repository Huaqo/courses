Landsat 8 uses broader NIR and Green bands with a 30m resolution, while Sentinel-2 uses narrower bands with a 10m resolution. Differences in atmospheric correction methods and time of capture could also be factors.

## Question 3

For the third question i choose the Chacao Channel as it is also a very interesting region because of its national parks agriculture and abundance of waterbodies.

Here the symbology was reduced to 0-0.2 because the calculations resultet in a peak around this area and near to zero values till 1. Which doenst make much sense because the area has a lot of waterbodies. I couldnt find and error.
