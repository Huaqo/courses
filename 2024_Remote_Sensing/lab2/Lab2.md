The original Raster file included values from -125 C which are not realistic in germany. Also Maximum temperatures from 44 degrees are not common, but could be explainable through realy heat conductiv material on very small areas.

Between Water bodies and land bodies. and also the north and south of the area.

The main differences of the map are the Bands and their display of it. For example the true color composite consists of band 2,3 and 4 in the order of RGB as 4,3,2. The false color composite consists of band 3,4 and 5 in the order ich which Vegetation is the most visible (5,4,3).

I choose this study area because i was on this island Chiloe in Chile for a bit and noticed a lot of National parks and vegeation there and i wanted to know how this changed in these past years. These two images show difference in NDVI between 2013 and 2024 of the island Chiloe in Chile and surroundings. I chose NDVI as it shows the difference in vegetation very well.
